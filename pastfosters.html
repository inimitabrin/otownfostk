            <p><b>Born:</b> October 1, 2016<br>
                <b>Story:</b> The Star Wars Kittens came to us as a trio from the Orange County shelter, just before Halloween. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and Princess Leia were underweight and full of parasites. It was touch-and-go for several weeks. Baby Luke was the smallest and sickest by far. He fought as long as he could, but his tiny body ultimately succumbed to septic shock caused by coccidiosis on November 6, 2016. In the rescue world we often say: "If love could have saved you, you would have lived forever." That was definitely true of baby Luke. Han Solo and Leia grew stronger, and were adopted together on December 11, 2016.</p></div>

            <p><b>Born:</b> October 10, 2016<br>
                <b>Story:</b> Cider, Cherry, and their four littermates were taped inside a cardboard box and left in front of a shelter. Despite that, these kittens were purry, trusting, loving babies from Day 1 as our fosters, with the personalities Maine Coons are known for. We are so happy they both found great families!!</p></div>

            <p><b>Born:</b> September 10, 2016<br>
                <b>Story:</b> Princess Purricane was found orphaned and alone, wandering the streets during Hurricane Matthew. She was about a month old, severely underweight, wounded, and crawling with fleas and parasites. After treated for her illness and injury, she was introduced to the liquor kitties, and Brandy began nursing her as one of her own kittens! Princess was one of our sweetest and most easygoing fosters. She is in an incredible home with several other black kitty sisters!</p></div>

            <p><b>Born:</b> August 27, 2016<br>
                <b>Story:</b> Brandy and her five two-week-old kittens came to me from the Orange County shelter. Brandy was sick with an upper respiratory infection, which she passed on to her kittens. Sambuca and Malibu, the two smallest, were at one point considered to have "fading kitten syndrome" and required intense supportive care while they fought for their lives. All of them recovered, and are in happy furever homes. They were so much fun and such loving kittens!!</p></div>
